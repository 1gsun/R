#### Analysis 1.Rmd
This R code provides:    
1) A code to intergrate the BNCmeta data with the BNC
2) A code to filter desired the corpus for BNC
3) A code to import the corpus for OANC 
4) A code to covert both corpus into dfm 
5) A code to calculate the FRE score and plot it
6) A code to use bag-of-words frame work to compute the weights of each features in both corpus
